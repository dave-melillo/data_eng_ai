        "Now that you've built a complete multi-agent news pipeline for Disney, take a moment to reflect:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Multi-Agent Architecture**\n",
        "* How did breaking the pipeline into specialized agents (extraction, sentiment, categorization, DDL) improve code organization?\n",
        "* What are the benefits of having separate agents vs. one large prompt that does everything?\n",
        "* How would you handle agent failures or rate limiting in production?\n",
        "* Could you parallelize some of these agents for better performance?\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Disney Business Line Classification**\n",
        "* How accurate was the AI at identifying Disney business lines?\n",
        "* What edge cases did you notice (e.g., articles about Disney+ movies)?\n",
        "* How would you validate the business_line classifications in production?\n",
        "* Should some articles belong to multiple business lines?\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Schema Evolution & Data Quality**\n",
        "* What happens when you add a new field to the pipeline?\n",
        "* How would you handle schema migrations in production?\n",
        "* What data quality checks would you add (duplicates, invalid dates, etc.)?\n",
        "* How would you monitor AI agent accuracy over time?\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Production Considerations**\n",
        "* How would you schedule this pipeline to run daily?\n",
        "* What error handling and retry logic would you add?\n",
        "* How would you handle API rate limits from NewsAPI and OpenAI?\n",
        "* What monitoring and alerting would you implement?\n",

        "1. **Add a new business line** like \"Theme Park Technology\" or \"Imagineering\" and update the categorization agent.\n",

        "2. **Create a duplicate detection agent** that checks if an article already exists in the database before inserting.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Build a summary agent** that creates executive-level summaries by business line (e.g., \"This week in Disney Parks: 3 positive articles about new attractions...\").\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Add a competitor analysis agent** that flags when articles mention Disney competitors (Universal, Warner Bros, Netflix, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Implement a data quality dashboard** that shows:\n",
        "   - Articles by business line over time\n",
        "   - Sentiment trends by region\n",
        "   - Topic distribution\n",

        "6. **Create an alert agent** that sends notifications when:\n",

You've seen how specialized agents can handle complex data engineering tasks while maintaining flexibility and code clarity. The Disney business line classification demonstrates how AI can add domain-specific intelligence that would be difficult to achieve with traditional rule-based systems.\n",
