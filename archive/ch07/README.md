# **Chapter 7: AI and Advanced Data Transformations**

## **Overview**  
Data transformation is a crucial step in ensuring high-quality, reliable data pipelines. In this chapter, we explore various techniques for handling and cleaning data, from traditional Python-based approaches to AI-driven solutions powered by OpenAIâ€™s Chat Completions API.  

## **Topics Covered**  
- **Handling and Imputing Missing Data**  
  Learn how to manage missing values using statistical methods (e.g., mean substitution) and AI-powered imputation techniques for dynamic, context-aware handling.  

- **Validating Data Against Reference Standards**  
  Discover how to validate datasets against predefined reference lists (e.g., ZIP codes, product categories) using rule-based methods and AI-driven contextual categorization.  

- **Normalizing Numerical Values**  
  Standardize numeric data, including ZIP codes, decimal formatting, and unit conversions, using Python and AI-based flexible transformations.  

- **Aligning Temporal Data Across Time Zones**  
  Convert timestamps from different time zones into a unified UTC format using traditional libraries like `pytz` and AI-driven adaptive parsing.  

- **Cleaning and Structuring Text Fields**  
  Remove unwanted characters, normalize text formats, and enhance usability using Python regex techniques and AI-powered natural language processing.

## **How to Use the Code**  
1. **Python-based transformations**  
   - Run traditional scripts (`7.1`, `7.6`, `7.8`, `7.10`, `7.12`) using `pandas`, `pytz`, and other standard Python libraries.  

2. **AI-driven transformations**  
   - Ensure you have an OpenAI API key.  
   - Install the OpenAI Python SDK:  
     ```sh
     pip install openai pandas
     ```  
   - Run AI-enhanced scripts (`7.2` through `7.13`), ensuring your API calls are configured correctly.
