# Chapter 1: Data Engineering and AI  

## Overview  

This chapter introduces the role of AI in data engineering, particularly focusing on how large language models (LLMs) enhance and streamline workflows. Key areas covered include:  

- Using AI as a coding companion  
- Automating data transformations in ETL/ELT  
- Feature engineering with AI  
- Understanding and refining prompt engineering
