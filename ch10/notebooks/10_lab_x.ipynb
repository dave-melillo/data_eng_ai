    "\n",
    "Write the scraping harness and extraction helpers. Your goal is to keep these functions small, but reliable enough to work across the URLs in this lab.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a `record` dictionary with these keys:\n",
    "   - `brand_name`\n",
    "   - `product_name`\n",
    "   - `product_url`\n",

    "   - `price` (default `None`)\n",
    "   - `status` (default `\"error\"`)\n",

    "3. Create `soup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"html.parser\")`.\n",
    "4. Extract title with `extract_title(soup)`.\n",
    "5. Extract price using:\n",
    "   - `extract_ruck_plate_variant_price` if the product name contains `\"ruck plate\"` (case-insensitive)\n",
    "   - otherwise use `extract_price_generic`\n",
    "6. Set:\n",
    "   - `status = \"success\"` if both title and price exist\n",
    "   - `status = \"missing_field\"` if the page was fetched but one of the fields is missing\n",
    "7. Wrap scraping logic in `try/except`.\n",
    "   - On exceptions, store the exception type in `status` (for example `error: HTTPError`).\n",
    "8. Append each record to a list named `results`.\n",
    "9. Add a short `time.sleep(1)` delay inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, convert `results` into a DataFrame named `out` and display it."
